## Application description:

## Task discription:
In this section, we focus on the task of displaying Outliers.

To begin with, we assume that the users will move their eyes to the left panel after seeing a blank space in the middle.
This is due to the fact that people tend to look at the middle of the page at their first sight, before noticing there is something on the left. We manage to keep the right space blank to get users' attentions to the panel.

Regarding habit of reading from left to right and from top to bottom, we put the Overview plot on the top of the panel, just below the description and selection of data. In this plot, users can feel the similiraty of data points in all of variables.

The tasks which users can explore more the data are put in Examplar plots that is below the Overview. Our first task is Outlier, and it can be easily seen on the top of this section. To open this task, user must click on it, then, the main views appears in the middle of the screen while an expanded views is on the right side. The main views include Focus view with the control panel which allows users to pick dimensions/variables, abtraction or visual feature.
